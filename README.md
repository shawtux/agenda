Site created from UserCake 2.X. The code has been cleaned up because alot of HTML was being created with [echo].

Also the registration form has been changed so as to not use a username. Also it adds the [RUT] for the chilean ID. At the momento it only validates that it be the right format 11222333-k or 11.222.333-k

In the DB folder you can find the updated MYSQLWorkbench schema to review and push to mysql.
